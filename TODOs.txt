===================
python load files
===================
==> loading from several directories
- keeping a external table per directory

==> tables missing
- hashtags, favorites, â€¦

==> upgrades
- when loading from several files, oracle is overwriting the log files
- log files from oracle should be also analyzed
- calculate retweets before analyzing (columns retweeted and retweeted_id)
- better way to avoid duplicates
- implement start_date and end_date of follower

==> refactoring
- directory path in config.properties
- launch from a process (now is unit test)

===================
python analysis
===================
==> upgrades
- graphs
- nl
- refactoring for clustering

===================
java collect process
===================
==> only streaming can be launched from process/mvn 
- rest api has to be launched with junit
- in particular, background process fetching slow rate user parameters


===================
database
===================
==> missing
- table for favorites


==> to be reviewed
